# Training and Evaluation

We provide bash scripts in [scripts/](../scripts) for each technique including prompt learning and other few-shot adaptation techniques.
Make sure to configure the dataset paths in environment variable `DATA` and run the commands from the main directory `BiomedCoOp/`.
Below we provide training and evaluation instructions for BiomedCoOp. The same instructions applies for all other techniques.


### Training time and compute
We train BiomedCoOp on each dataset with a batch size of 4 using a **single** NVIDIA A100 GPU. Currently, multi-GPU training is not supported. You will have to specify the GPU number that you want to use.

## BiomedCoOp

#### (1) Few-shot evaluation setting

The default training settings are provided in the config files at `configs/trainers/BiomedCoOp/few_shot`. All hyper-parameters can be modified using this config file.

Below, we provide instructions to train BiomedCoOp on any dataset. 

```bash
# All possible dataset values include [btmri, busi, chmnist, covid, ctkidney, dermamnist, kneexray, kvasir, lungcolon, octmnist, retina]

# CLIP Models include [CLIP, PubMedCLIP, PMCCLIP, BiomedCLIP]

# trains and evaluates in a few-shot setting on all 3 seeds
CUDA_VISIBLE_DEVICES=<GPU number> bash scripts/biomedcoop/few_shot.sh <data directory> <dataset> <nb of shots> <clip model to use>
# Example on BTMRI using 16 shots and the BiomedCLIP model on GPU 0
CUDA_VISIBLE_DEVICES=0 bash scripts/biomedcoop/few_shot.sh data btmri 16 BiomedCLIP
```

#### Averaging results over 3 seeds: 
Once the above trainings and evaluations are completed, the `output/` directory should have the following structure:

```
output
|–– btmri/
|   |–– shots_16/
|   |   |–– BiomedCoOp_BiomedCLIP/
|   |   |   |–– nctx4_cscFalse_ctpend/
|   |   |   |   |–– seed1/
|   |   |   |   |–– seed2/
|   |   |   |   |–– seed3/
```

Now use the script `parse_test_res.py` and run the commands below to calculate the averaged results:
```bash
# prints averaged results
python parse_test_res.py output/btmri/shots_16/BiomedCoOp_BiomedCLIP/nctx4_cscFalse_ctpend --test-log
```

The above steps can be repeated for other individual datasets.

#### (2) Base-to-Novel class generalization setting

```bash
# All possible dataset values include [btmri, chmnist, covid, ctkidney, dermamnist, kneexray, kvasir, lungcolon, octmnist, retina]

# CLIP Models include [CLIP, PubMedCLIP, PMCCLIP, BiomedCLIP]

# trains and evaluates on base and novel classes
CUDA_VISIBLE_DEVICES=<GPU number> bash scripts/biomedcoop/base2new.sh <data directory> <dataset> <clip model to use>
# Example on BTMRI using the BiomedCLIP model on GPU 0
CUDA_VISIBLE_DEVICES=0 bash scripts/biomedcoop/base2new.sh data btmri BiomedCLIP
```

#### Averaging results over 3 seeds: 
Once the above trainings and evaluations are completed, the `output/` directory should have the following structure:

```
output
|–– base2new/
|   |–– test_new/
|   |   |–– btmri/
|   |   |   |–– shots_16/
|   |   |   |   |–– BiomedCoOp_BiomedCLIP/
|   |   |   |   |   |–– nctx4_cscFalse_ctpend/
|   |   |   |   |   |   |–– seed1/
|   |   |   |   |   |   |–– seed2/
|   |   |   |   |   |   |–– seed3/
|   |–– train_base/
|   |   |–– btmri/
|   |   |   |–– shots_16/
|   |   |   |   |–– BiomedCoOp_BiomedCLIP/
|   |   |   |   |   |–– nctx4_cscFalse_ctpend/
|   |   |   |   |   |   |–– seed1/
|   |   |   |   |   |   |–– seed2/
|   |   |   |   |   |   |–– seed3/
```

Now use the script `parse_test_res.py` and run the commands below to calculate the averaged results:
```bash
# prints averaged results for base classes
python parse_test_res.py output/base2new/train_base/btmri/shots_16/BiomedCoOp_BiomedCLIP/nctx4_cscFalse_ctpend
# averaged results for novel classes
python parse_test_res.py output/base2new/test_new/btmri/shots_16/BiomedCoOp_BiomedCLIP/nctx4_cscFalse_ctpend --test-log
```

The above steps can be repeated for other individual datasets.

#### (3) Domain Generalization setting

In the domain generalization setting, the model is trained on a source dataset and evaluated on unseen target datasets without any target-domain fine-tuning.

```bash
# Source dataset values include [busi, btmri]

# Source-to-target mappings:
# busi  -> [buid, busb, busbra, udiat]
# btmri -> [btmri_p, btmri_m, btmri_n, btmri_b, btmri_s, brisc]

# CLIP Models include [CLIP, PubMedCLIP, PMCCLIP, BiomedCLIP]

# trains on the source dataset and evaluates on all target domains
CUDA_VISIBLE_DEVICES=<GPU number> bash scripts/biomedcoop/dg.sh <data directory> <source dataset> <nb of shots> <clip model to use>
# Example on BUSI using 16 shots and the BiomedCLIP model on GPU 0
CUDA_VISIBLE_DEVICES=0 bash scripts/biomedcoop/dg.sh data busi 16 BiomedCLIP
```

#### Averaging results over 3 seeds:
Once the above trainings and evaluations are completed, the `output/` directory should have the following structure:

```
output
|–– dg/
|   |–– busi/
|   |   |–– shots_16/
|   |   |   |–– BiomedCoOp_BiomedCLIP/
|   |   |   |   |–– nctx4_cscFalse_ctpend/
|   |   |   |   |   |–– seed1/
|   |   |   |   |   |–– seed2/
|   |   |   |   |   |–– seed3/
|   |–– buid/
|   |   |–– shots_16/
|   |   |   |–– BiomedCoOp_BiomedCLIP/
|   |   |   |   |–– nctx4_cscFalse_ctpend/
|   |   |   |   |   |–– seed1/
|   |   |   |   |   |–– seed2/
|   |   |   |   |   |–– seed3/
|   |–– busb/
|   |–– busbra/
|   |–– udiat/
```

Now use the script `parse_test_res.py` and run the commands below to calculate the averaged results on each target domain:
```bash
# Example: averaged DG results for the BUSI -> BUID target domain
python parse_test_res.py output/dg/buid/shots_16/BiomedCoOp_BiomedCLIP/nctx4_cscFalse_ctpend --test-log

# To parse all BUSI target domains
for TARGET in buid busb busbra udiat
do
    python parse_test_res.py output/dg/${TARGET}/shots_16/BiomedCoOp_BiomedCLIP/nctx4_cscFalse_ctpend --test-log
done

# To parse all BTMRI target domains
for TARGET in btmri_p btmri_m btmri_n btmri_b btmri_s brisc
do
    python parse_test_res.py output/dg/${TARGET}/shots_16/BiomedCoOp_BiomedCLIP/nctx4_cscFalse_ctpend --test-log
done
```

The above steps can be repeated for each supported source dataset.

#### Reproducing Results

Our trained model checkpoints can be found on HuggingFace [here](https://huggingface.co/TahaKoleilat/BiomedCoOp)

Run the following scripts to use the checkpoints and get testing results. Note that the following scripts automatically download the desired model weights:

```


##### (3) Domain Generalization

```bash
